Riddles of the Sphinx
In Greek myth, the Sphinx guarded the gates of the city Thebes. Travelers could only pass the Sphinx if they correctly answered a riddle. Build an application where a user has to answer a series of the Sphinx's riddles in order to get into the city. Woe to the user that answers incorrectly! Your application should have a "success" page (for users that correctly answer all riddles) and a "failure" page if one of the riddles is answered incorrectly. You can find examples of the Sphinxâ€™s riddles online or you can use your own. The focus of this project is to practice routing. Do not attempt the further explorations until you have a basic application with hard-coded riddles and complete routing first.

Further Exploration
Turn this into a CRUD application: users can create, update and delete their own riddles.
Once you have a set of riddles a user can answer, add a random option so users see different riddles each time they play. Hint: Implement a Riddle.random() class method. This method does not need to be tested.
Make the Sphinx more forgiving. Allow a user to have one or more chances to get a riddle wrong. If the riddle is answered incorrectly, then the Sphinx can give a clue.
Update your application so the Sphinx is instead guarding treasure and/or knowledge, such as endless gold or the secret of eternal life. Allow users to solve riddles to get different final outcomes (beyond just entering the city gates).
